Simple Linear Regression formula
--------------------------------
y=b0 +b1*x1
y=a+bx
y=dependent variable --> That is something you explain
                      --> like salary based on years
x=independent variable--> That is number of years which is needed to get salary(prediction)
b=factor

Salary VS Expereience
---------------------
1)plot

2)Regression
------------------------
a---> y-intercpt--> here salary for a fresher

salary=a+b*expereince -->This is a straight line

now we have to get the best fitting line which passes through maximum points

actual salary yi
and modeled salary y'i

calc --> sum of (yi-y'i)**2

To get the best fitting line --> has the minum sum of (yi-y'i)**2
