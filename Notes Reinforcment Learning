Reinforcement Learning is a branch of Machine Learning,
also called Online Learning.
 It is used to solve interacting problems where the
 data observed up to time t is considered to decide which
 action to take at time t + 1.
 It is also used for Artificial Intelligence when
 training machines to perform tasks such as walking.
  Desired outcomes provide the AI with reward,
   undesired with punishment.
    Machines learn through trial and error.
