Heya!

I am going through this amazing journey of Blockchain/ML.The course is completley practical oriented and has some real life data-sets, 
and i am jotting down every single point and writing super nice student friendly comments so that anyone 
can understand and can give it a try! All the codes are in the form snippets so you can download and use where time is a factor!
make sure ur data sets dimensions are entered properly the rest will be magic!
