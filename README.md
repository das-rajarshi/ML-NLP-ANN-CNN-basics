Heya!

I am going through this amazing journey of Blockchain/ML.The course is completley practical oriented and has some real life data-sets, 
and i am jotting down every single point and writing super nice student friendly comments so that anyone 
can understand and can give it a try! All the codes are in the form snippets so you can download and use where time is a factor!
make sure ur data sets dimensions are entered properly the rest will be magic!

Once i am done with Machine Learning from the course i will try to merge the blockchain applications and get some fake
Distributed Ledger data and see what all we can do! Maybe we can classify shit!,Maybe we can predict shit! OMG! OMG! Keep tracking fellas
