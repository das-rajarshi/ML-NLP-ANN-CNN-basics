     ---> This is how exactly how amazon reccomendation system workd
     ---> All types of recommendation systems work like this

This algo has three parts
a) Support
b) confidence --> Number of people who saw m1,m2 / people_who_saw_m1
c) lift       --> Confidence/support

Suppport--> users watched movie M / total_number_of_users



Step 1: Set a minimum support and confidence
Step 2: Take all the suests in transactions having higher support than minimum support
Step 3: Take all the rules of these subsets havng higher confidence than minimum confidence
Step 4: Sort the rules by decreasing lift

the rule with highest lift is prefered--> consider for implementation
