Artificial Neural Netework
---------------------------
the neuron ---> We need to recreate the nueron in the machine

neuron recieves input from other neurons and the neuron passes info to other neurons

inputs have weights
and training involves adjusting the weight of the neuron

all the weights get added  after multiplying into activation function
then based on the activation function the signal is decided weather it should be passed
or not


Activation Function
=====================

four predominent activation functio

x-axiss --> weighted sum
y-axis --> value of activation function

1. Treshold function
if y > activation function then send
   y< activation function then dont send

2. Sigmoid --> generally used in the output function
3. Rectifier (has kink at Zero) --> generally in the hidden layer
4. Hyperbolic Tangent function

Neural Network Working
-----------------------
not all inputs might have weight at certain times

Learinng
-------
all output values are compared to previous value

predicted value y^
actual value y
cost value (y^-y)* 0.5
the y^ , based on cost value we will change the weights







Convolutional Neural Networks
--------------------
1. Convolution
2. Max Pooling
3. Flattening
4. Full Connect
